# SSL

## Installation notes (please document fully when first running the process)

The company we use is RapidSSL from Trustico

If you have to renew a cert, then get a receipt and give it to Nicola as an expense who will reimburse it.

Go for the cheapest one that works!

In terms of setting up the SSL cert on Engine Yard, again this was done by Matt in an undocumented way.

You could google it, and follow something like: https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/21016553-Obtain-and-Install-SSL-Certificates-for-Applications

Or https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/50644293-Obtain-and-Install-SSL-Certificates

We don't have an account login with Trustico - they just email the details.

Make liberal use of ey support: https://www.engineyard.com/support/plans/standard
